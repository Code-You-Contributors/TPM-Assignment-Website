      <h2>Technical Project Management (TPM) Participant Handbook</h2>
      <p>This document outlines how Technical Project Managers work with program graduates to help them grow beyond Code:You, through real-world projects, team habits, and professional practices that prepare them for the next step in their career.</p>
      <p>Our goal: build meaningful, portfolio-worthy work <strong>and</strong> help you develop the habits that make you successful in any team environment.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions about anything you read in this guide, please reach out to one of the Technical Project Managers, Danny Morton or David York, via email (<a href="mailto:danny@codeyou.org">danny@codeyou.org</a> or <a href="mailto:david@codeyou.org">david@codeyou.org</a>) or Slack.</p>

        <li>Practicing <strong>professional communication</strong>.</li>
        <li>Building a <strong>public record of your skills</strong> (GitHub activity, issue tracking, and documentation).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By showing steady progress and collaboration, you’re building trust with teammates and future employers, and making work you can proudly share in your portfolio.</p>

      <p>-OR-</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get hired for a technical or technology-related position at any point while active in the caseload</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Next Steps After Graduation</h3>
      <p>These aren’t a requirement to be completed after graduation, but are best practices to simplify the job search process.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post on LinkedIn about the process of working on the project, what you learned, barriers you overcame, things you could have done differently, features you’re proud of, etc. with a link to the project (if possible), and/or your portfolio/GitHub</li>
        <li>Attend multiple local (or remote) networking events/technology groups to build your connections in the industry</li>
        <li>Apply to jobs and reach out to people associated with the job on LinkedIn (recruiters, hiring managers, other engineers, HR)</li>
        <li>Continue to build on your projects, add more features, complete things you started but didn’t finish, simplify code, have others review your code</li>
        <li>Create micro-projects on technologies or tools that are in demand and interesting to you. Make posts on LinkedIn about these as you’re building them and once they’re completed. Make sure they’re at least publicly viewable on GitHub</li>
        <li>Look for positions you can move to in your current company that are more technically focused</li>
        <li>Find ways to implement your tech skills into your current workplace, even if it’s outside your immediate job description. It’s a good way to get experience, can spur your employer to move you into a more technical role, and shows initiative</li>
      </ul>
